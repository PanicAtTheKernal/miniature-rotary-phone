# Description
Birds, Butterflies and Robot is a team project that showcases the simplicity yet intricate wonders and beauty of nature,
In this simulation, the user can observe a small island with lifeforms  such as butterflies that float and wander the island seeking nearby flowers, birds that 
soar through the skies enjoying the winds and finally a curious robot fascinated by these living beings all whilst listening to a beautiful melody.

The simulation allows many customisations in the UI including how many butterflies to spawn, the birds wing size, their speed, night or day, volume control and much more.

Each team member or individual needs to write a paragraph or two explaining what they contributed to the project

- What they did
- What they are most proud of
- What they learned

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
